# Environments

No additional detail here yet.

## Required Services such as configuration can be provisioned by environments
## No code changes should be required for moving from one evironment to another
## Staged environments should be as close to equivalent as possible
## Environments should be entirely isolated from eachother, if they are not then they should be considered a single logical environment
## Environments are a major source of erosion, so resource usage and environmental side effects should be monitored and constrained.
